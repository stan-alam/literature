The degree of similarity between the stories of Utanapishtim and of Noah is well demonstrated in a comparison of their respective accounts of the aftermath of the Great Flood. The Mesopotamian survivor relates his ordeal to Gilgamesh as follows:
   Six days and seven nights the gale-winds blew,
   The rain poured down, the Flood flattened the land.
   But when the seventh day dawned
   The winds died down, and the water subsided.
   The sea that had writhed like a woman in labor
   Now was calm, the storm over, the Deluge ended.
   I opened a window, and sunlight fell on my face.
  {xi} I looked at the weather, and it was perfectly calm,
  But all of the people had turned into clay,
  And the land was as flat as the roof of a house.
  I sank to my knees and wept,
  Tears running all down my face.
  I scanned the ocean’s horizon in all directions
  And saw fourteen patches of land emerging.
  The ship came to ground on Nimush Mountain,
  Mount Nimush held it fast and did not let it move.
  A first day and a second day Nimush Mountain
  held the boat fast and did not let it move.
  A third day and a fourth day Nimush Mountain
  held the boat fast and did not let it move.
  A fifth day and a sixth day Nimush Mountain
  held the boat fast and did not let it move.
  When the seventh day dawned 
  I brought out a dove and let it go.
  The dove flew off but then came back to me;
  There was no place to land and so it came back.
  I brought out a swallow and let it go.
  The swallow flew off but then came back to me;
  There was no place to land and so it came back.
  I brought out a raven and let it go.
  The raven flew off and saw the water subsiding.
  It found food, cawed, and did not come back.
  Then I sacrificed incense to the Four Winds,
  Pouring out offerings on the mountain top.
  I set out seven pots and another seven,
  Piling beneath them cane, cedar, and myrtle.
  The gods smelled the savor, smelled the sweet savor,
  And gathered like flies around the sacrifice.
  (Tablet XI 120–57)


The King James Bible describes the conclusion of Noah’s tribulations thus:
 
4. And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat. 5. And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen. 
{xii} 6. And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made: 7. And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth. 8. Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground; 9. But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters were on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark. 10. And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark;
11. And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.
12. And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any more. 13. And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry. . . . 20. And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean beast, and of every
clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar. 21. And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man’s sake; for the imagination of man’s heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done. (Genesis 4–14, 20–21)
Despite efforts to utilize these two accounts as evidence for an actual worldwide (or at least regional) catastrophe, there is no geological evidence for synchronous wide-ranging flooding over the entirety of the Near East, let alone the entire Earth. More significantly, the narrative details here—the exploration by means of birds, the coming to rest of the vessel upon particular mountains, the burnt offerings presented immediately upon disembarkation—indicate that the texts partake of a single literary tradition. The direction of borrowing is not in doubt: Since “The Story of Atrahasis” was inscribed hundreds of years prior to the earliest possible date for the composition of the Hebrew Bible, the tale must be of Mesopotamian origin. Most likely, intellectuals among the Judahites exiled to Babylonia in the sixth century BCE, some of whom learned {xiii} cuneiform in order to serve in the local bureaucracy, adopted the story from their Babylonian “schoolbooks” or scribal colleagues. 
A major difference between the Biblical and Akkadian accounts is the role the Deluge plays within the respective national traditions. In the Hebrew Bible, as an incident within the development of their relationship to God as set forth in the Torah, men bring their destruction upon themselves as a result of their wicked behavior. While after the trial God promises not to repeat the eliminationist flooding, he insists that human nature remains essentially evil.

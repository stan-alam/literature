## notes on Asimov's guide on Shakespeare

```text
Shakespeare's genius is marked by his rare ability to appeal to theatergoers
of all types and all levels of education. But for most modern folks, the
Greek and Roman mythology and history, let alone the history of England and
the geography of sixteenth-century Europe that his works are laden with, are
hardly within our grasp. Isaac Asimov comes to making obscure issues clear to
the layperson, selects key passages from 38 of the great bard's plays plus
two of his narrative poems and, with the help of beautifully rendered maps an
figures, illuminates us about their historical and mythological background.

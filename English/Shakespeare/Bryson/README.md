## notes on Bill Bryson's Shakespeare

```text
William Shakespeare, the most celebrated poet in the English language,
left behind nearly a million words of text, but his biography has long
been a thicket of wild supposition arranged around scant facts. With a
steady hand and his trademark wit, Bill Bryson sorts through this colorful
muddle to reveal the man himself.

Bryson documents the efforts of earlier scholars, from academics to eccentrics.
Emulating the style of his famous travelogues, Bryson records episodes in his
research, including a visit to a bunker-like basement room in Washington, D.C.,
 where the world's largest collection of First Folios is housed.

Bryson celebrates Shakespeare as a writer of unimaginable talent and enormous
inventiveness, a coiner of phrases ("vanish into thin air," "foregone conclusion,
" "one fell swoop") that even today have common currency. His Shakespeare is
like no one else'sâ€”the beneficiary of Bryson's genial nature, his engaging
skepticism, and a gift for storytelling unrivaled in our time

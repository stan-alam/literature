A Thousand Splendid Suns: A Novel
Written by: Khaled Hosseini

Mariam was the daughter of an unwed mother who committed suicide; at 15, she is married off to 40-year-old Rasheed, who brutally abuses her, especially after she loses several pregnancies to miscarriage. His cruel attitudes to women become the norm when the Taliban take control of Afghanistan shortly afterwards, and Mariam resolves to keep her head down and just survive. Twenty years later, Rasheed takes in 14-year-old Laila, whose parents were killed by stray bombs, and soon he turns violent with her as well. The two women, thrown together by war and loss, develop a quiet friendship, and when an opportunity arises for Laila to discover a chance at happiness, that bond will make all the difference. Kahled Hosseini's exquisite and heart-wrenching novel captures the difficult choices and enormous sacrifices Afghan women had to make in hopes that the girls they knew would have a better future.

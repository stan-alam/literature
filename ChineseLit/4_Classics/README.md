Dreams of the red chamber is the most difficult read among the 6 classics, as it involves a lot of deep interpretation of the work, while the work was technically half completed as the author died half way through the novella, with another author came in to finish it off. Dreams of the red chamber itself spawns a specialized academic field, “Redology”, attributed to the study of the work.

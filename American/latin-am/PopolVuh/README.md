## notes on Popol Vuh

```text
Just as the Brits have their ancient epic poetry, so does Latin America have the
Popol Vuh, a narrative by the K’iche’ people of (present-day) Guatemala telling
their creation myths, and tales of warriors and heroes. Written down by a visiting
missionary in about 1550, the Popol Vuh is one of the only remaining traces of what
was once a vibrant oral tradition of storytelling in pre-Columbian America.

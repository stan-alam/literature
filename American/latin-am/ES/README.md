 ## notes on I Am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter by Erika L. Sánchez

```text
Holden Caulfield is the classic disaffected teen, known for slouching around
New York decrying phonies and having a depressive crisis. Julia, the protagonist of
Erika L. Sánchez’s coming-of-age novel, wanders the streets of Chicago confronting
the confines of the expectations her parents have for her life, while also confronting
the mysteries of her recently deceased sister’s life. I Am Not Your Perfect Mexican
Daughter takes the same anger and sadness around the limitations of relationships and
the world that Holden Caulfield experiences, and filters them through the experiences
of a Mexican teen girl growing up in America.

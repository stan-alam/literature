## notes on No One Will See Me Cry by Cristina Rivera Garza
```text
The Bell Jar is a feminist classic about growing up, aimlessness, and depression,
and a bulk of the book takes place with the main character in a psychiatric hospital.
With No One Will See Me Cry, Rivera Garza takes us into La Castaneda, the infamous turn-of-the-century asylum in Mexico City, to follow the path of one of its inmates
and the inmate photographer. Garza has been lauded as one of the best novelists
working in Mexico by writers like Carlos Fuentes, and is becoming better known
in the states.

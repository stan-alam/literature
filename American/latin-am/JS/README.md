## notes on Hopscotch by Julio Cortázar

```text
James Joyce is best known for using not only stream-of-consciousness narration,
but for his inventive use of language, making up words as they suited him and
engaging in wordplay like puns and allusions. Cortázar uses similar structure
and language to tell the story of a love affair between Horacio Oliveira and La
Maga, a mysterious woman who comes in and out of the story. The book is almost
structured like a choose-your-own adventure story, and the “Table of Instructions”
invites you to plot your own path through the text.

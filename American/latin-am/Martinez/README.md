## notes on Santa Evita by Tomás Eloy Martínez
```text
While Evita’s corpse doesn’t come lurching back to life in Tomás Eloy Martínez’s
novel, it’s not for lack of trying. This book, melding fact and fiction about
Evita Perón, the wife of Argentina’s dictator, focuses not on her living biography
but on the fate of her body after death. A madcap story with a zany cast of characters
all trying to reclaim control of the corpse, much like Frankenstein, Santa
Evita also raises deeper questions about death, legacy, and politics.

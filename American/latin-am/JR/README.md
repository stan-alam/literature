## notes on Pedro Paramo by Juan Rulfo

```text
Spooky semi-abandoned agricultural towns, the dissolution of a once-grand family,
innovations in prose styling – Pedro Paramo has a lot of the things that make Sound
and the Fury great, and is one of the most influential books in Latin American
lit to boot. With no lesser writers than Gabriel García Márquez, Jorge Luis Borges,
and Valeria Luiselli describing this book as an inspiration to them, to read this
work is to uncover some of the earliest roots of magical realism.

## notes on Signs Preceding the End of the World by Yuri Herrera
```text
A migration across a vast, unwelcoming territory, the tensions of family, a
wider arc of socio-political movement. Signs Preceding the End of The World treats
migration into the United States in the same way that The Grapes of Wrath treats the
Dust Bowl migrations of Oklahoma â€“ by at once humanizing it and placing it within a
greater context. Signs comes with the added benefit of being an absolutely fresh,
vibrant modern novel.

## notes on the poetry of Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz
```text
Shakespeare and Sor Juana were only divided by 100 years of history – while the Bard
was writing love poems, comedies and tragedies around the late 1500s, the New Spanish
nun was writing religious (and romantic!) poetry, philosophical essays, and theological
tracts in the 1600s. Much like Shakespeare, she adhered to the formal structures of
verse at the time – sonnets using meter and rhyme schemes. She, like Shakespeare, is
also speculated to have hidden clues to her queerness in some of her writing; scholars
have argued that some of her sonnets, addressed to “Lisi,” were about María Luisa
Gonzaga Manrique de Lara, the wife of the Spanish Viceroy.

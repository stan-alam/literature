## notes on El Señor Presidente by Miguel Ángel Asturias
```text
Everything Machiavelli said to do, the title president in Asturias’ novel does.
Written in the 1930s as a condemnation of Guatemalan dictator Manuel Estrada Cabrera,
it’s one of the first novels written about life under a dictatorship, and the dangers
everyday citizens faced. A modern classic, Asturias would later go on to win a
Nobel prize in Literature, largely for this work.

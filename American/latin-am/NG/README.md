## notes on Man-Making Words by Nicolás Guillén
```text
Just as Frost’s poetry focused on his home turf – rural New England – with a
particular emphasis on the colloquial and homey, so too did Guillén take the raw
materials of the people around him and transform them into poetry. Guillén’s most
famous work, Motivos de Son (not translated into English in its entirety), took a
traditional Cuban musical genre, and mined it for its connections to Afro-Cuban
experiences and life. The works included in Man-Making Words deal with similar
subjects, and take as their focal point Afro-Cuban culture – alongside Guillén’s
recognizable onomatopoeia in mimicking the drums and sounds of Afro-Cuban music.
In addition, he shares a connection to someone else often included in the American
canon – he and Langston Hughes were friends, and Hughes translated some of his poems
into English.

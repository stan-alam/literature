Bloom divides his Canon into the following four "Ages":

    The Theocratic Age: 2000 BCE-1321 CE;
    The Aristocratic Age: 1321-1832;
    The Democratic Age: 1832-1900;
    The Chaotic Age: 20th Century;

A. The Theocratic Age

“Since the literary canon is at issue here, I include only those religious, philosophical, historical, and scientific writings that are themselves of great aesthetic interest. I would think that, of all the books that are in this first list, once the reader is conversant with the Bible, Homer, Plato, the Athenian dramatists, and Virgil, the crucial work is the Koran . . .

“I have included some Sanskrit works, scriptures and fundamental literary texts, because of their influence on the Western canon. The immense wealth of ancient Chinese literature is mostly a sphere apart from Western literary tradition and is rarely conveyed adequately in the translations available to us.” (p. 531)

B. The Aristocratic Age

“It is a span of five hundred years from Dante's Divine Comedy through Goethe's Faust, Part Two [1321-1832], an era that gives us a huge body of reading in five major literatures: Italian, Spanish, English, French, and German.

“In this and in the remaining lists, I sometimes do not mention individual works by a canonical master, and in other instances I attempt to call attention to authors and books that I consider canonical but rather neglected.

“From this list onward, many good writers who are not quite central are omitted. . . . ” (p. 534)

Naturally, Donald spoke mostly about Donald. “I was having the greatest year of my business career,” he began, a heavily edited portrayal of his ever-changing fortunes. “I was sitting having breakfast thinking about how well things were going for me,” when he got the news that his father had died.

 perfect night for The Twilight Zone. And this episode was one of the best ever, “Time Enough at Last.” Burgess Meredith—the Penguin from Batman—is a bank teller who really loves to read. That’s all he wants to do. Read, read, read. He’s in the bank vault one day on his lunch break, reading of course, when the room begins to shake around him. The world has blown up, and human life as we know it is destroyed. But as the lonely book lover wanders the empty city, he starts to think maybe this isn’t so bad. Now, he’ll have more time for reading.

All in the Family: The Trumps and How We Got This Way

But he’d had a terrible relationship with my father, who blamed him for ruining his life.
Note: 08.05.2024

It was one of those can’t-live-together, can’t-live-apart situations. But it was my father, his namesake, who died just shy of his forty-third birthday with an ex-wife and two teenage children. So, you tell me: Who paid the ultimate price?

The outbreak almost certainly originated in America, perhaps at Fort Riley in Kansas, where the first case of the virus was recorded. It was said that overcrowded and unsanitary conditions created a fertile breeding ground.

 perfect night for The Twilight Zone. And this episode was one of the best ever, “Time Enough at Last.” Burgess Meredith—the Penguin from Batman—is a bank teller who really loves to read. That’s all he wants to do. Read, read, read. He’s in the bank vault one day on his lunch break, reading of course, when the room begins to shake around him. The world has blown up, and human life as we know it is destroyed. But as the lonely book lover wanders the empty city, he starts to think maybe this isn’t so bad. Now, he’ll have more time for reading.

I look for the signs from a nonverbal boy—his face, his posture, his expressions, his eyes. I’ve learned to “speak” that language too. William operates through gestures, expressions, and assistive technology. Though he doesn’t have the motor skills for an iPad, tech is more and more a part of his daily independence.

He can’t tell us when something is broken, whether it’s his bone or his heart. We are the chief investigators of all things William, and it’s made us incredibly intuitive.

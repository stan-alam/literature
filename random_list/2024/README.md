Villa E by Jane Alison [F]

The Princess of 72nd Street by Elaine Kraf [F]

Kraf’s 1979 feminist cult classic, reissued as part of Modern Library’s excellent Torchbearer series with an introduction by Melissa Broder, follows a young woman artist in New York City who experiences wondrous episodes of dissociation. Ripe author Sarah Rose Etter calls Kraf “one of literature’s hidden gems.” —SMS



All That Glitters by Orlando Whitfield [NF]

Whitfield traces the rise and fall of Inigo Philbrick, the charasmatic but troubled art dealer—and Whitfield’s one-time friend—who was recently convicted of committing more than $86 million in fraud. The great Patrick Radden Keefe describes this as “an art world Great Gatsby.” —SMS



The Bookshop by Evan Friss [NF]

Oh, so you support your local bookshop? Recount the entire history of bookselling. Friss’s rigorously researched ode to bookstores underscores their role as guardians, gatekeepers, and proprietors of history, politics, and culture throughout American history. A must-read for any bibliophile, and an especially timely one in light of the growing number of attempts at literary censorship across the country. —DF



Mystery Lights by Lena Valencia [F]

Valencia’s debut short story collection is giving supernatural Southwestern Americana.  Subjects as distinct as social media influencers, ghost hunters, and slasher writers populate these stories which, per Kelly Link, contain a “deep well of human complexity, perversity, sincerity, and hope.” —DF

Mourning a Breast by Xi Xi, tr. Jennifer Feeley

This 1989 semi-autobiographical novel is an account of the late Hong Kong author and poet Xi’s mastectomy and subsequent rey, heralded as one of the first Chinese-language books to write frankly about illness, and breast cancer in particular.—SMS



Village Voices by Odile Hellier [NF]

Hellier celebrates the history and legacy of the legendary Village Voice Bookshop in Paris, which he founded in 1982. A hub of anglophone literary culture for 30 years, Village Voice hosted everyone from Raymond Carver to Toni Morrison and is fondly remembered in these pages, which mine decades of archives. —SMS



Dinosaurs at the Dinner Party by Edward Dolnick [NF]

Within the past couple of years, three tweens found the fossilized remains of a juvenile Tyrannosaurus rex in North Dakota and an 11-year-old beachcomber came upon an ichthyosaur jaw in southwestern England, sparking scientific excitement. Dolnick’s book revisits similar disies from Darwin’s own century, when astonished amateurs couldn’t yet draw upon centuries of paleontology and drew their own conclusions about the fossils and footprints they unearthed. —NodB



All the Rage by Virginia Nicholson [NF]

Social historian Nicholson chronicles the history of beauty standards for women from 1860 to 1960, revealing the fickleness of fashion, the evergreen pressure put on women’s self-presentation, and the toll the latter takes on women’s bodies. —SMS



A Termination by Honor Moore [NF]

In her latest memoir, Moore—best known for 2008’s The Bishop’s Daughter—reflects on the abortion she had in 1969 at the age of 23 and its aftermath. The Vivian Gornick calls this one “a masterly account of what it meant, in the 1960s, to be a woman of spirit and intelligence plunged into the particular hell that is unwanted pregnancy.” —SMS



Nat Turner, Black Prophet by Anthony E. Kaye with Gregory P. Downs [NF]

Kaye and Downs’s remarkable account of Nat Turner‘s rebellion boldly and persuasively argues for a reinterpretation of the uprising’s causes, legacy, and divine influence, framing Turner not just as a preacher but a prophet. A paradigm-shifting work of narrative history. —SMS



An Honest Woman by Charlotte Shane [NF]

As a long-time reader, fan, and newsletter subscriber of Shane’s, I nearly dropped to my knees at the altar of Simon & Schuster when her latest book was announced. This slim memoir intertwines her experience as a sex worker with reflections on various formative relationships in her life (with her sexuality, her father, and her long-time client, Roger), as well as reflections on the very nature of sex, gender, and labor. —DF



Mina’s Matchbox by Yoko Ogawa, tr. Stephen B. Snyder [F]

Mina’s Matchbox is an incredible novel that affirms Ogawa’s position as the great writer of fantastical literature today. This novel is much brighter in tone and detail than much of her other, often brutal and gloomy, work, but somehow the tension and terror of living is always at the periphery. Ogawa has produced a world near and tender, but tough and bittersweet, like recognizing a lost loved one in the story told by someone new. —Zachary Issenberg



Jimi Hendrix Live in Lviv by Andrey Kurkov, tr. Reuben Woolley [F]

The Grey Bees author’s latest, longlisted for last year’s International Booker Prize, is an ode to Lviv, western Ukraine’s cultural capital, now transformed by war. A snapshot of the city as it was in the early aughts, the novel chronicles the antics of a cast of eccentrics across the city, with a dash of magical realism thrown in for good measure. —SMS

The Hypocrite by Jo Hamya [F]

I loved Hamya’s 2021 debut novel Three Rooms, and her latest, a sharp critique of art and gender that centers on a young woman who pens a satirical play about her sort-of-canceled novelist father, promises to be just as satisfying. —SMS



A Complicated Passion by Carrie Rickey [NF]

This definitive biography of trailblazing French New Wave filmmaker Agnès Varda tells the engrossing story of a brilliant artist and fierce feminist who made movies and found success on her own terms. Film critic and essayist Phillip Lopate writes, “One could not ask for a smarter or more engaging take on the subject.” —SMS

The Italy Letters by Vi Khi Nao [F]

This epistolary novel by Nao, an emerging queer Vietnamese American writer who Garielle Lutz once called “an unstoppable genius,” sounds like an incredible read: an unnamed narrator in Las Vegas writes sensual stream-of-consciousness letters to their lover in Italy. Perfect leisure reading on a sultry summer’s afternoon while sipping a glass of prosecco. —CK



Survival Is a Promise by Alexis Pauline Gumbs [NF]

Gumbs’s poetic, genre-bending biography of Audre Lorde offers a fresh, profound look at Lorde’s life, work, and importance undergirded by an ecological, spiritual, and distinctly Black feminist sensibility. Eloquent Rage author Brittany Cooper calls Gumbs “a kindred keeper of [Lorde’s] lesbian-warrior-poet legacy.” —SMS



Planes Flying Over a Monster by Daniel Saldaña París, tr. Christina MacSweeney and Philip K. Zimmerman [NF]

Over 10 essays, the Mexican writer Daniel Saldaña Paris explores the cities he has lived in over the course of his life, using each as a springboard to ponder questions of authenticity, art, and narrative. Chloé Cooper Jones calls Saldaña Paris “simply one of our best living writers” and this collection “destined for canonical status.” —SMS



The Unicorn Woman by Gayl Jones [F]

The latest novel from Jones, the Pulitzer finalist and mentee of Toni Morrison who first stunned the literary world with her 1975 novel Corregida, follows a Black soldier who returns home to the Jim Crow South after fighting in World War II. Imani Perry has called Jones “one of the most versatile and transformative writers of the 20th century.” —SMS



Becoming Little Shell by Chris La Tray [NF]

When La Tray was growing up in western Montana, his family didn’t acknowledge his Indigenous heritage. He became curious about his Métis roots when he met Indigenous relatives at his grandfather’s funeral, and he searched in earnest after his father’s death two decades later. Now Montana’s poet laureate, La Tray has written a memoir about becoming an enrolled member of the Chippewa Little Shell Tribe, known as “landless Indians” because of their history of forced relocation. —NodB



Wife to Mr. Milton by Robert Graves (reissue) [F]

Grave’s 1943 novel, reissued by the great Seven Stories Press, is based on the true story of the poet John Milton‘s tumultuous marriage to the much younger Mary Powell, which played out amid the backdrop of the English Civil War. E.M. Forster once called this one “a thumping good read.” —SMS

Euphoria Days by Pilar Fraile, tr. Lizzie Davis [F]

Fraile’s first novel to be translated into English follows the lives of five workers approaching middle age and searching for meaning—turning to algorithms, internet porn, drugs, and gurus along the way—in a slightly off-kilter Madrid of the near future. —SMS

# September
Colored Television by Danzy Senna [F]

Senna’s latest novel follows Jane, a writer living in L.A. and weighing the competing allures of ambition versus stability and making art versus selling out. The perfect read for fans of Lexi Freiman‘s Book of Ayn, Colored Television is, per Miranda July, “addictive, hilarious, and relatable” and “a very modern reckoning with the ambiguities triangulated by race, class, creativity and love.”—SMS



We’re Alone by Edwidge Danticat [NF]

I’ve long been a big fan of Danticat, and I’m looking forward to reading this essay collection, which ranges from personal narratives to reflections on the state of the world to tributes to her various mentors and literary influences, including James Baldwin and Toni Morrison. That the great Graywolf Press published this book is an added bonus. —CK



In Our Likeness by Bryan VanDyke [F]

Millions contributor Bryan VanDyke’s eerily timely debut novel, set at a tech startup where an algorithm built to detect lies on the internet is in the works, probes both the wonders and horrors of AI. This is a Frankenstein-esque tale befitting the information (or, perhaps, post-information) age and wrought in VanDyke’s typically sparkling prose. —SMS



Liontaming in America by Elizabeth Willis [NF]

Willis, a poet and professor at the Iowa Writers’ Workshop, plumbed personal and national history for last year’s Spectral Evidence: The Witch Book, and does so again with this allusive hybrid work. This ambitious project promises a mind-bending engagement with polyamory and family, Mormonism and utopianism, prey exercising power over predators, and the shape-shifting American dream. —NodB



Creation Lake by Rachel Kushner [F]

I adore Kushner’s wildly offbeat tales, and I also enjoy books and movies in which people really are not who they claim to be and deception is coming from all sides. This novel about an American woman who infiltrates a rural commune of French radicals and everyone has their private agenda sounds like the perfect page-turner. —CK



Under the Eye of the Big Bird by Hiromi Kawakami, tr. Asa Yoneda [F]

Kawakami, of Strange Weather in Tokyo and People in My Neighborhood fame, returns with a work of speculative fiction comprising 14 interconnected stories spanning eons. This book imagines an Earth where humans teeter on the brink of extinction—and counts the great Banana Yoshimoto as a fan. —SMS



Homeland by Richard Beck [NF]

Beck, an editor at n+1, examines the legacy of the war on terror, which spanned two decades following 9/11, and its irrevocable impact on every facet of American life, from consumer habits to the very notion of citizenship. —SMS



Herscht 07769 by László Krasznahorkai, tr. Ottilie Muzlet [F]

Every novel by Krasznahorkai is immediately recognizable, while also becoming a modulation on that style only he could pull off. Herscht 07769 may be set in the contemporary world—a sort-of fable about the fascism fermenting in East Germany—but the velocity of the prose keeps it ruthilarious and dreamlike. That’s what makes Krasznahorkai a master: the world has never sounded so unreal by an author, but all the anxieities of his characters, his readers, suddenly gain clarity, as if he simply turned on the light. —ZI



Madwoman by Chelsea Bieker [F]

Catapult published Bieker’s 2020 debut, Godshot, about a teenager fleeing a religious cult in drought-stricken California, and her 2023 Heartbroke, a collection of stories that explored gender, threat, and mother-and-child relationships. Now, Bieker moves over to Little, Brown with this contemporary thriller, a novel in which an Oregon mom gets a letter from a women’s prison that reignites violent memories of a past she thought she’d left behind. —NodB



The World She Edited by Amy Reading [NF]

Some people like to curl up with a cozy mystery, while for others, the ultimate cozy involves midcentury literary Manhattan. Amy Reading—whose bona fides include service on the executive board of cooperative indie bookstore Buffalo Street Books in Ithaca, N.Y.—profiles New Yorker editor Katharine S. White, who came on board at the magazine in 1925 and spent 36 years editing the likes of Elizabeth Bishop, Janet Flanner, and Mary McCarthy. Put the kettle on—or better yet, pour a classic gin martini—in preparation for this one, which underscores the many women authors White championed. —NodB



If Only by Vigdis Hjorth, tr. Charlotte Barslund [F]

Hjorth, the Norwegian novelist behind 2022’s Is Mother Dead, painstakingly chronicles a 30-year-old married woman’s all-consuming and volatile romance with a married man, which blurs the lines between passion and love. Sheila Heti calls Hjorth “one of my favorite contemporary writers.” —SMS



Fierce Desires by Rebecca L. Davis [NF]

Davis’s sprawling account of sex and sexuality over the course of American history traverses the various behaviors, beliefs, debates, identities, and subcultures that have shaped the way we understand connection, desire, gender, and power. Comprehensive, rigorous, and unafraid to challenge readers, this history illuminates the present with brutal and startling clarity.  —SMS



The Burning Plain by Juan Rulfo, tr. Douglas Weatherford [F]

Rulfo’s Pedro Páramo is considered by many to be one of the greatest novels ever written, so it’s no surprise that his 1953 story collection The Burning Plain—which depicts life in the aftermath of the Mexican Revolution and Cristero Revolt—is widely seen as Mexico’s most significant (and, objectively, most translated) work of short fiction. —SMS

My Lesbian Novel and TOAF by Renee Gladman [F/NF]

The perpetually pitch perfect Dorothy, a Publishing Project is putting out two books by Renee Gladman, one of its finest regular authors, on the same day: a nigh uncategorizable novel about an artist and writer with her same name and oeuvre who discusses the process of writing a lesbian romance and a genre-smashing meditation on an abandoned writing project. What’s not to love? —JHM



Dear Dickhead by Virginie Despentes, tr. Frank Wynne [F]

I’m a big fan of Despentes’s caustic, vigorous voice: King Kong Theory was one of my favorite reads of last year. (I was late, I know!) So I can’t wait to dig into her latest novel—purported to be taking France by storm—which nods to #MeToo in its depiction of an unlikely friendship that brings up questions of sex, fame, and gendered power. —SMS



Capital by Karl Marx, tr. Paul Reitter [NF]

In a world that burns more quickly by the day—after centuries of industrial rapacity, and with ever-increasing flares of fascism—a new English translation of Marx, and the first to be based on his final revision of this foundational critique of capitalism, is just what the people ordered. —JHM

Fathers and Fugitives by S.J. Naudé, tr. Michiel Heyns [F]

Naudé, who writes in Afrikaans, has translated his previous books himself—until now. The first to be translated by Heyns, a brilliant writer himself and a friend of Naudé’s, this novel follows a queer journalist living in London who travels home to South Africa to care for his dying father, only to learn of a perplexing clause in his will. —SMS



Men of Maize by Miguel Ángel Asturias, tr. Gerald Martin [F]

This Penguin Classics reissue of the Nobel Prize–winning Guatemalan writer’s epic novel, just in time for its 75th anniversary, throws into stark relief the continued timeliness of its themes: capitalist exploitation, environmental devastation, and the plight of Indigenous peoples. Héctor Tobar, who wrote the forward, calls this “Asturias’s Mayan masterpiece, his Indigenous Ulysses.” —SMS



Good Night, Sleep Tight by Brian Evenson [F]

It is practically impossible to do, after cracking open any collection of stories by the horror master Evenson, what the title of this latest collection asks of its readers. This book is already haunting you even before you’ve opened it. —JHM



Reservoir Bitches by Dahlia de la Cerda, tr. Julia Sanches and Heather Cleary [F]

De la Cerda’s darkly humorous debut story collection follows 13 resilient, rebellious women navigating life in contemporary Mexico. Dogs of Summer author Andrea Abreu writes, “This book has the force of an ocean gully: it sucks you in, drags you through the mud, and then cleanses you.” —SMS



Lost: Back to the Island by Emily St. James and Noel Murray [NF]

For years, Emily St. James was one of my favorite TV critics, and I’m so excited to see her go long on that most polarizing of shows (which she wrote brilliantly about for AV Club way back when) in tandem with Noel Murray, another great critic. The Lost resurgence—and much-deserved critical reevaluation—is imminent. —SMS



Scaffolding by Lauren Elkin [F]

Who could tire of tales of Parisian affairs and despairs? This one, from critic and Art Monsters author Elkin, tells the story of 40 years, four lives, two couples, one apartment, and that singularly terrible, beautiful thing we call love. —JHM



Bringer of Dust by J.M. Miro [F]

The bold first entry in Miro’s sweeping Victorian-era fantasy was a novel to revel in. Ordinary Monsters combined cowboys, the undead, a Scottish magic school, action better than most blockbuster movies can manage, and refreshingly sharp prose astonishingly well as its batch of cast of desperate kids confused by their strange powers fought to make sense of the world around them—despite being stalked, and possibly manipulated, by sinister forces. That book’s climax upended all expectations, making Bringer of Dust something rare: a second volume in a fantasy where readers have no idea where things are heading. —AS



Frighten the Horses by Oliver Radclyffe [NF]

The latest book from Roxane Gay‘s eponymous imprint is Radclyffe’s memoir of coming out as a trans man in his forties, rethinking his supposedly idyllic life with his husband and four children. Fans of the book include Sabrina Imbler, Sarah Schulman, and Edmund White, who praises Radclyffe as “a major writer.” —SMS



Everything to Play For by Marijam Did [NF]

A video game industry insider, Did considers the politics of gaming in this critical overview—and asks how games, after decades of reshaping our private lives and popular culture, can help pave the way for a better world. —SMS



Rejection by Tony Tulathimutte [F]

Tulathimutte’s linked story collection plunges into the touchy topics of sex, relationships, identity, and the internet. Vauhini Vara, in describing the book, evokes both Nabokov and Roth, as well as “the worst (by which I mean best) Am I the Asshole post you’ve ever read on Reddit.” —SMS

Elizabeth Catlett by Ed. Dalila Scruggs [NF]

This art book, which will accompany a retrospective at the Brooklyn Museum organized by Scruggs, spotlight the work and legacy of the pioneering printmaker, sculptor, and activist Elizabeth Catlett (1915-2012), who centered the experiences of Black and Mexican women in all that she did and aspired “to put art to the service of the people.” —SMS



The Repeat Room by Jesse Ball [F]

I often credit Jesse Ball’s surrealist masterpiece A Cure for Suicide with reviving my love of reading, and his latest got me out of my reading slump once again. Much like ACFS, The Repeat Room is set in a totalitarian dystopia that slowly reveals itself. The story follows Abel, a lowly garbageman chosen to sit on a jury where advanced technology is used to forcibly enter the memories of “the accused.” This novel forces tough moral questions on readers, and will make you wonder what it means to be a good person—and, ultimately, if it even matters. —DF



Defectors by Paola Ramos [NF]

Ramos, an Emmy Award–winning journalist, examines how Latino voters—often treated as a monolith—are increasingly gravitating to the far right, and what this shift means America’s political future. Rachel Maddow calls Defectors “a deeply reported, surprisingly personal exploration of a phenomenon that is little understood in our politics.” —SMS



Monet by Jackie Wullshläger [NF]

Already available in the U.K., this biography reveals a more tempestuous Claude Monet than the serene Water Lilies of his later years suggest. Wullschläger, the chief art critic of the Financial Times, mines the archives for youthful letters and secrets about Monet’s unsung lovers and famous friends of the Belle Époque. —NodB



Brooklynites by Prithi Kanakamedala [NF]

Kanakamedala celebrates the Black Brooklynites who shaped New York City’s second-largest borough in the 19th century, leaving a powerful legacy of social justice organizing in their wake. Centering on four Black families, this work of narrative history carefully and passionately traces Brooklyn’s activist lineage. —SMS



No Ship Sets Out to Be a Shipwreck by Joan Wickersham [NF]

In this slim nonfiction/poetry hybrid, Wickersham (author of National Book Award finalist The Suicide Index) meditates on a Swedish warship named Vasa, so freighted with cannons and fancy carvings in honor of the king that it sank only minutes after leaving the dock in 1682, taking 30 lives with it. After Wickersham saw the salvaged Vasa on display in Stockholm, she crafted her book around this monument to nation and hubris. —NodB

Health and Safety by Emily Witt [NF]

I loved Witt’s sharply observed Future Sex and can’t wait for her latest, a memoir about drugs, raves, and New York City nightlife which charts the New Yorker staff writer’s immersion into the city’s dance music underground on the cusp of the pandemic—and the double life she began to lead as a result. —SMS

 I’m trying  to write  a story about  the promise of  New York. The longer I write, the more it changes, the more I’m afraid. I’ll get it all wrong, I  won’t shake the old habits, and they’ve  heard the story before: they know about artists and gentrification,

To choose  a life  in (and  of)  art is  absurd; always  has been.  But today,  in hypergentrified,  postpandemic New  York  City, it	feels  impossible. Countless	books  proffer advice on  how to endure  the realities  of living an  artist’s  life.2 This isn’t one of them.

. Without generational  wealth or occasional  famil- ial support, maintaining  an art practice over  a lifetime forces a reevaluation  of  one’s relationship	to  labor—working  at work (the job) and working on art  (the work). Work will devour you.

Ray enrolled at the  University of Kentucky, worked at a bakery and finally earned his BFA after six years of stopping and start- ing. Down and out in a trailer park, then down and out in Paris. He was finally a credentialed artist. Now what.

Institutions construct an atmosphere  of gravity and distinction.On the inside,student  work is framed as consequen- tial, it  matters. The sociologist  Gary Allen  Fine compares  art school to a medieval monastery, “a castle surrounded by a moat, keeping the barbarians  out—and the select  within.”2 Lines are drawn. Some students  develop technique, if  compelled, and at minimum,

Artists described living in  a “state of psychosis,” and recovering from an “art school concussion.

That’s  the  catch. Art  school  provides an	insulated  den of freedom, but it’s  a temporary hideout. A’s  in art school aren’t a barometer of whether work will make it to a gallery  or a collec- tor

An artist is their  work. If it has no intrinsic value, then  they must negotiate the ambiguity between worth and worthlessness.

If you  can make it through that fourteen months, then it gets better, presumably.”  When I asked if that was his experience, he laughed,“Yeah, I guess.”After a moment he said,“I think maybe it’s getting easier, maybe, maybe.”I never saw him again.

After art  school, Ray didn’t make  any money from  his art. He just sat there. Newly lettered, he had no  art-world connections,

Instead of climbing the ladder,exhibiting work and being subject to critical review, Murillo was championed by 1  percent collectors, among them Don  and Mera Rubell, “two  of the  most influential and perhaps most beloved contemporary art collectors of our time,”6 who  hoarded enough	art  to open	their  own private	museum in	Miami.  He	was	questionably	compared	to	Jean	Michel Basquiat.

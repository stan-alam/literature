## Books in Marilyn Monroe's Library

The list is mostly from Marilyn's own book collection, as catalogued for the Christie's auction. They came from her private estate, or books she herself mentioned reading. I agree she probably didn't read all of them from cover to cover, I certainly haven't read every book on my shelf. But it does give you an insight into the depth of her interest. Arthur Miller said that although she didn't always finish books, she was able to grasp the gist of them very quickly.

Piranesi's house is no ordinary building: its rooms are infinite, its corridors endless, 
its walls are lined with thousands upon thousands of statues, each one different from all 
the others. Within the labyrinth of halls an ocean is imprisoned; waves thunder up staircases, 
rooms are flooded in an instant.
